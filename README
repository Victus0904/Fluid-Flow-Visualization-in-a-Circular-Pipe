# Fluid Flow Visualization in a Circular Pipe

This project is a C++ simulation visualizing fluid flow in a circular pipe using the parabolic velocity profile, developed with the SFML graphics library.

## Features

- Interactive window displaying a pipe and moving particles that illustrate laminar flow.
- Adjustable parameters such as pipe radius, length, and velocity profile.
- Built for educational and demonstration purposes in fluid mechanics and engineering.

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher compiler
- [SFML 2.6.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/) (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

## Getting Started

### Building (Linux / macOS)

1. Install SFML 2.6.1:<br/>
   - Ubuntu:  `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` (check if version 2.6.1 is in official repos; if not, download from SFML website and build from source)
   - Fedora:  `sudo dnf install SFML` (ensure version is 2.6.1)
   - macOS:   `brew install sfml` (for latest version, use Homebrew or build from source)

2. Clone this repository.

3. Compile with g++:
